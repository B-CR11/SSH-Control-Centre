Hello!

This is a fully functional SSH Control Centre for your Servers.

Just add your Server's Name and Hostname, The Key for the Server, and away you go!

You can add commands at the bottom, which will save and can be run against as many nodes as you wish.

All information is saved between refreshes to .json files, so you don't need to keep reinputting the same data.

# USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

1. Copy all files to your local machine
2. Run "pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Navigate to config.py and set your Username and Password
4. Run the application using python3: python3 run.py

##Â NOTE ##

1. You may rename all of the files, but make sure you update the dependencies to reflect the new filenames 

Have Fun!

Critch :)
