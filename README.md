Hello!

This is a fully functional SSH Control Centre for your Servers.

Just add your Server's Name and Hostname, The Key for the Server, and away you go!

You can add commands at the bottom, which will save and can be run against as many nodes as you wish.

All information is saved between refreshes to .json files, so you don't need to keep reinputting the same data.

Have Fun!

Critch :)
